# ComManDo
`ComManDo` utilizes the `UnionCom` framework and correspondence estimation to perform semi-supervised cross-modality embedding with inspiration from `CLUE`.  the main model uses an autoencoder to map input modalities onto similar spaces.  the trained model can then be used for further mapping or cross-modal estimation.

Various optimizations are also included.  Currently, functionality in standard methods (`tsne`, etc.) is limited but will be added back at a later date.
